                                     the short term. Before outlining the specific objectives, let's briefly discuss
                                     the role of economic models. Economic models are simplified representations of 
                                     reality. They are not intended to capture every detail of the real world but 
                                     rather to clarify economic relationships in a more straightforward manner. In 
                                     this course, our aim is to build a general understanding of macroeconomic interactions,
                                     specifically how government policies and central bank actions can impact the economy.
                                     Itâ€™s important to remember this perspective as we introduce new features or assumptions
                                     along the way."),
