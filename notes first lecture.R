- relate output and prices to micro, why is it more difficult 
in macro than in micro
- most is spent on services
- start with an economy of two firms (same example as I have)
- show in three different ways how to compute GDP
- what we see from this example is that production is the same as income and 
  this is very important and also specific for macro. The income that is earned
  is spent on the same goods (the aggregate good).
- Real vs nominal GDP  why is the line for real GDP flatter than the line for 
  nominal GDP (Graph nominal and real GDP)
- After GDP he is doing unemployment: an unemployed person does not have a job 
  but is looking for one
  How is it measured? Mostly surveys
- unemployment rate chart why is low unemployment a problem (related to inflation)
  lots of aggregate demand -> lots of output -> low unemployment
  but also low participation rate (chart)
  why do we see this rise in the participation rate in the US from the 60ies onwards (women)
  participation rate is declining again and after covid not enough came back
  people thought this will be temporary but now it is becoming a concern that this
  will be permanent
- then cover inflation GDP deflator is another price index; CPI
  
- interest rates at last
  
  
- goods market is the first model, we want to find equilibrium output
